# Hi there, I'm Dev Jadhav 👋

## 🚀 Production AI/ML Engineer | Building Enterprise Multi-Agent Systems | AI Safety Advocate

I'm obsessed with the intersection of **reliability engineering** and **autonomous intelligence**—building Agentic AI systems that don't just "chat" but **act**: diagnosing infrastructure, mitigating incidents, and reasoning over complex telemetry with minimal human-in-the-loop latency.

Currently: **Lead Machine Learning Engineer @ ING Nederland**

### 🎯 Core Technical Focus

**🤖 Agentic Architectures**  
Designing stateful, multi-agent systems and custom orchestration layers to solve non-deterministic problems in SRE and DevOps.

**⚙️ LLMOps & Evals**  
Engineering rigorous evaluation harnesses and CI/CD pipelines for non-deterministic software, ensuring safety and alignment in enterprise deployments.

**⚡ ML System Optimization**  
Accelerating inference (vLLM, TGI, quantization) and training (3D parallelism: DP/TP/PP) for open-weights models (Mistral, Gemma, Llama) to achieve cost-effective scale.

### 🔬 Building in Public

**🧠 DeepSeek Implementation Series**  
Built educational implementations of DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3.2 from scratch—every tensor operation, every attention mechanism, every expert routing decision.

**Three implementations:**
- **Rust + Candle** (Metal/GPU) — Inference-optimized for Apple Silicon
- **PyTorch** (CUDA/MPS/CPU) — Distributed training with Flash Attention
- **MLX** — Native Apple Silicon development

**Key architectures implemented:**
- Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) — 93% KV cache reduction
- DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA) — Hybrid local + dilated patterns
- 256-expert MoE with hierarchical routing
- Multi-Token Prediction for improved sample efficiency
- 5D Parallelism (Tensor, Pipeline, Data, Expert, Sequence)

**🔍 Current Research**
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardizing agent-observability integrations
- GNN-based anomaly detection for 3D parallelism in distributed training systems
- DualPipe implementation for advanced pipeline parallelism

### 🛠️ Production AI Engineer

My background spans the full stack of computational hardness—**from embedded C++ optimization on ARM microcontrollers to distributed training pipelines on AWS/GCP**. This "**bits to billions**" perspective allows me to build AI systems that are not only intelligent but fundamentally **performant and secure**.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Languages:** Python, Rust, Go, C++
- **ML/AI:** PyTorch, JAX, CUDA, MLX, Candle, TensorFlow
- **LLM Infra:** vLLM, TGI, Ray, Modal, DeepSpeed, FSDP, Flash Attention
- **MLOps:** Kubernetes, Docker, Airflow, MLflow, ZeRO, 3D Parallelism
- **Cloud:** AWS (GenAI SME), GCP, Azure

### 💡 What Drives Me

I bring the rare ability to understand both **cutting-edge AI architectures** and the **operational realities of serving them at scale**—exactly what's needed to bridge research and production.

My work focuses on the messy realities: How to make models reliable. How to handle failures gracefully. How to build systems that scale beyond proof-of-concept.
